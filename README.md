This is the beginnings of a general-purpose Python package for running self-organized sentence processing (SOSP; Smith, Franck, & Tabor, 2018; Smith & Tabor, submitted) simulations for human sentence processing.

Currently, only small models are supported, i.e., models of single-word reading times where the parameters are set manually, but I plan to gradually add the ability to create a parser directly from a parsed corpus so that the parsing of whole sentences is possible.
